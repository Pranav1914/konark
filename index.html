        <p>Designed to resemble Surya's colossal chariot, the temple features twelve pairs of intricately carved stone wheels and is drawn by seven horses, symbolizing the days of the week. Each wheel is about 3 meters in diameter and is elaborately decorated with symbolic motifs.</p>

        <p>The temple's exterior is adorned with a multitude of sculptures, ranging from deities and celestial beings to animals and intricate floral patterns. Notably, the temple includes erotic carvings, reflecting the cultural openness of the era. The main sanctum, which once housed the deity's idol, was designed to allow the first rays of the sunrise to illuminate the inner sanctum, highlighting the temple's astronomical significance.</p>

        <p>In recognition of its architectural brilliance and cultural significance, the Konark Sun Temple was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, the temple stands as a testament to India's rich cultural heritage, attracting visitors worldwide who come to marvel at its intricate artistry and historical grandeur.</p>
